        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR ( 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015)
        was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th
        president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family
        in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering.
        He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
        mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
        India's civilian space programme and military missile development
        efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
        work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
        technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
        and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
        first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5] Kalam was
        elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both
        the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian
        National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he
        returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
        after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards,
        including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. While
        delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
        Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July
        2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
        attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where
        he was buried with full state honours.[8]

        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
        Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
        Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
        Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
        local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13]
        His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
        Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the
        youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His
        ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
        numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim
        ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent
        from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
        trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from
        Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.
        With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however,
        the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
        the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
        poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to
        sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. [19][20][21] In
        his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright
        and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours
        on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his
        education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam
        went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where
        he graduated in Physics in 1954.[22] Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to
        study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While
        Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied
        with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship
        unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met
        the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting
        you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He
        narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he
        placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in
        the IAF.[24]
